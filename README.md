# Modulations-Expert

Modulations-Expert is a software package for automatic recognition of analog and digital modulations.

- Modulations-Expert is MATLAB GUI-based toolbox for automatic modulation recognition.
- The toolbox can be used for generating arbitrary datasets of modulations.
- The toolbox provides multiple machine learning-based classifiers to be trained using the obtained datasets. 
- Blind demodulation is implemented for QAM, PSK, DPSK, OQPSK, QAM, and FSK.
-	Visualization techniques are provided for insight on modulation classification.

To run Modulations-Expert you need 64-bit MATLAB R2015b or newer releases for Windows.
